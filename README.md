## Project motivation
#### Introduction
In today's fast-paced and competitive job market, breaking into the professional world can often feel like navigating a labyrinth. The abundance of qualified candidates has led recruiters to raise the bar, often seeking individuals who are not just capable but overqualified. Additionally, the advent of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) has further complicated the job search process. These systems, designed to streamline hiring, filter applications based on keyword matches, sometimes overlooking a candidate's true potential.
This project emerges as a response to these challenges. It leverages technology to demystify the hiring landscape, providing clarity on what skills are truly valued. This clarity not only aids job seekers in honing the right competencies but also in presenting themselves in a manner that aligns with what employers are actively seeking, making the professional world a bit more navigable and accessible.

#### Motivation
By creating an automated system that scrapes LinkedIn to analyze the top skills required for desired job positions, I aim to achieve the following:
This project was conceived as a means to hone my abilities as a Data Scientist. By tackling the complexities of web scraping and data analysis, I aimed to push my boundaries and expand my technical skill set. Moreover, showcasing this project on my portfolio demonstrates my proactive approach to solving real-world problems, highlighting my capability and creativity to potential employers.
One of the primary motivations behind this project was to identify the top skills required in the data science domain. Understanding which skills are in high demand allows me to prioritize my learning efforts, ensuring that I am well-prepared to meet the expectations of the job market. This enhances my ability to position myself as a competitive candidate in the professional landscape.

#### Disclaimer
To further enhance my skills, I made this project reproducible so it works for any job description and location specified. However, please be aware:
This project was undertaken for educational purposes and as a personal tool to assist in my job search. I do not endorse or take responsibility for any use of this project by others for their own benefit.
